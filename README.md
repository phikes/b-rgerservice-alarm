# b-rgerservice-alarm
Makes Macs beep when a certain number was called for Bürgerservice at the main station in Aachen. I live nearby so I go home in the meantime and set the alarm to ~5 numbers before my number. I have only implemented for the main queue, not the one for people with disabilities. WTFPL

Use it like so: `alarm 290` if you want beeps for number A290.
