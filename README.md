# b-rgerservice-alarm
Makes Mac beep when a certain number was called for BÃ¼rgerservice at the main station in Aachen. I live nearby so I go home in the mean time and set the alarm to ~5 numbers before my number. I have only implemented for the main queue, not the one for people with disabilities. WTFPL
